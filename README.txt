Microsoft Vision SDK, May 2000, Release 1.2


INTRODUCTION

The Microsoft Vision SDK is a library for writing programs to perform image
manipulation and analysis on computers running Microsoft Windows operating
systems.  The Microsoft Vision SDK was developed by the Vision Technology
Research Group in Microsoft Research to support researchers and developers
of advanced applications, including real-time image-processing applications.
It is a low-level library, intended to provide a strong programming
foundation for research and application development; it is not a high-level
platform for end-users to experiment with imaging operations.  The Microsoft
Vision SDK includes classes and functions for working with images, but it
does not include image-processing functions.  The Microsoft Vision SDK is a
C++ library of object definitions, related software, and documentation for
use with Microsoft Visual C++.

Getting started documentation is contained in a Word document named
"VisSDK.doc" which is located in this direcotry.

The classes and functions used in the Vision SDK are documented in the
"Vision SDK.chm" file in the Help directory.  Raw HTML help files are
available from http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/vision/.

More information about the Vision SDK, including a list of Frequently
Asked Questions, is also available on:
