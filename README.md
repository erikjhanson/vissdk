Old (outdated) C++ Microsoft Vision SDK that I wrote when I was in Microsoft Research.

This is an example of the type of work that I used to do in C++.
It is a low-level library for working with images in image processing and
computer vision applications on Windows.

A good overview of the library is in the [VisSDK.doc](VisSDK.doc) file.

Detailed documentation of the classes is in the complied HTML file [Help/Vision SDK.chm](Help/Vision%20SDK.chm).
To view it, you will need to click the "view raw" option and download the documentation.
Then you will need to right-click on the file, select "Properties", and click the box
at the bottom to "unblock" the content.
