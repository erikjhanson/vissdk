# vidsdk
Old (outdated) C++ Microsoft Vision SDK that I wrote when I was in Microsoft Research.

This is an example of the type of work that I used to do in C++.

Documentation is in the complied HTML file [Help/Vision SDK.chm](Help/Vision%20SDK.chm).
You will probably need to click the "view raw" option and download the documentation to view it.
